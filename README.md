# RNN-on-EELS-data
Code for running running a recurrent neural network(RNN) on EELS data, developed for the mrs open data challenge https://www.mrs.org/open-data-challenge. The code relies on dm4reader https://github.com/jamesra/dm4reader to read the EELS data and this must be downloaded separately. The code builds on previous work by Joshua Agar (https://github.com/jagar2/Revealing-Ferroelectric-Switching-Character-Using-Deep-Recurrent-Neural-Networks).
